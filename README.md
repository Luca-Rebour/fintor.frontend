  <h2>Fintor</h2>
  <p>
    Fintor is a personal finance management application designed to help users gain
    full visibility and control over their money.
  </p>

  <p>The app allows you to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create and manage multiple accounts (bank accounts, cash, savings, etc.)</li>
    <li>Track one-time and recurring income</li>
    <li>Register recurring subscriptions and fixed expenses</li>
    <li>Add categorized expenses linked to specific accounts</li>
    <li>Create financial goals (e.g., Buy a car, Buy a house, Travel)</li>
    <li>Allocate funds from accounts to goals while keeping balances clearly separated</li>
    <li>Visualize financial data through charts and summaries</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Fintor differentiates between <strong>available money</strong> and
    <strong>allocated money</strong>, so users always know what can be spent and what
    is already committed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal of the project is to provide a clear, structured, and practical tool for
    personal financial planning, with a strong focus on usability, transparency, and
    long-term financial organization.
